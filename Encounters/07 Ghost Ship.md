## 03 Alhoon Lair

### Path from Ship to Lair

* Chasm filled with ghostly light
* Wisdom saves for detect thoughts
* Visions of past failure/fears
	* Kelward (Marya) - You see the face of a woman. Familiar, yet alien in some way. She's standing on the deck of a ship. She lifts her gaze towards you but has no pupils. Instead her once blue eyes are empty glass spheres, an emotionless expression on her face. Slowly across her neck a slit opens, but there is no blade only blood. As the color drains from her face, she blinks for the last time as her expression grows slack. You see now your own reflection in her eyes which now glow a beautiful iridescent pink.
