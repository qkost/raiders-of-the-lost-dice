		* This book describes various mundane techniques and theories related to foiling magic traps. If you spend 48 hours studying this book, you learn how to overcome certain types of magic traps with your thieves’ tools. If a trap’s magic can be dispelled or suppressed by a dispel magic spell, you can make a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to achieve the same result. The DC of the Dexterity check is equal to 5 + the DC required to dispel or suppress the trap with dispel magic (minimum DC 18). On a failed check, the trap triggers.
