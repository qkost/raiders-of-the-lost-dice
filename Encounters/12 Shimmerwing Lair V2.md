	*  A few small private side chambers allow the dragon (usually in Humanoid guise) to meet with visitors.

# W4: Cloud Bridge

* Description
	* From the antechamber, visitors travel upward along a path of clouds. The impressive route is not as dangerous as its lack of railings and the literal airiness of each footstep might suggest.

# W5: Open Court

* Description
	* Past the cloud bridge is an enormous expanse of smooth stone ringed with broken pillars, where the silver dragon hosts visitors in grand style. Though this court is often surrounded by clouds, the dragon can clear them away with a moment’s thought, revealing a breathtaking view of the surrounding region.
