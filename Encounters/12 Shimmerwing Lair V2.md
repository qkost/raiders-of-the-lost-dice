Their essence locked in eternal fight.

Three guardians absent from the stride.
One of each breed has a missing ward,
Name chromatic, metallic, and gem for reward.

If a trap’s magic can be dispelled or suppressed by a dispel magic spell, you can make a Dexterity check using thieves’ tools to achieve the same result. The DC of the Dexterity check is equal to 5 + the DC required to dispel or suppress the trap with dispel magic (minimum DC 18). On a failed check, the trap triggers.
