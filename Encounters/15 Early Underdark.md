```
Eight pallbearers carry
The queen across the floor.

Three true, five false
protect her hoard.

Light and dark,
Magic and sight.

Her gifts to her children
reveal those right.

For those unwise
She weaves her shroud

Bound and broken
They move no more.
```

## Drow Ruin

Eight pallbearers carry
The queen across the floor.

Three true, five false
protect her hoard.

Her gifts to her children
reveal those chosen.

For those that fail
She weaves her shroud

To make sure that
They move no more.
