## Villian: [[Lady Thinora Va'del, Archmage of Antiquity]]

## Monologue

  
Ah, well, well, well. What do we have here? A tiefling, genasi, tortle, and an aarakocra? Very conspicuous. Very unique. You must be those pitiful imbeciles trying to play the hero, aren't you? Quite frankly, you are way over your heads.

Oh, you may have foiled that simpleton Duskheart, who bone-headedly tried to steal the Tear in broad daylight; a plan those fools executed against my explicit advice, I may add. But do not be mistaken; you are no more significant than the ants you crush beneath your boots.

What this situation calls for is a far more delicate touch.

Now, my dears, the question becomes, what should I do with you? Oh, I would take immense pleasure in obliterating you right here and now, but alas, corpses tend to raise questions, and I despise loose ends.

Ah, I have it! I have a far more exquisite purpose for you. Somebody must have spirited away with the Tear after all, and I believe you will make the most splendid of scapegoats.

Whether you get a head start running or stay to watch the action matters not to me.
