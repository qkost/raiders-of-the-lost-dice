## Intro

In a realm where truth is twined with lies,  
Through a labyrinth of glass, you seek allies.  

Trust not the face that meets your gaze,  
For deception walks the mirrored maze.

The true path forward, a bond tattered,  
Revealed in glass, with the lie shattered.

So remember, adventurers so brave and keen,  
In worlds of mirrors, not all is as seen.
