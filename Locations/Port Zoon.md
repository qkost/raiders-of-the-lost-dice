###### Exterior Description

The Timuafa Tower stands as a striking landmark in the Assay Sphere of Port Zoon. The tower's exterior is constructed from dark, polished stone, etched with intricate arcane symbols that glow faintly in various hues, suggesting the presence of potent magical energies within. The base of the tower is fortified with reinforced metal plates, giving it an imposing and sturdy appearance. Spiraling up the structure are metallic bands that crackle with occasional sparks of arcane energy, a testament to the ongoing experiments inside.

Large, ornate windows are scattered irregularly along the tower’s height, each fitted with colored glass that filters the light into eerie, magical hues. At night, the windows glow softly, casting a mystical aura around the tower. A series of balconies adorned with brass railings and telescopic instruments jut out at various levels, providing platforms for stargazing and observing weather patterns.
