#### Potion Brewing
**The instructions:**

For those who seek the room past the void,
An assortment lies before you, five you must avoid.
To start the brew, neither end you should pick
Second inside, only one will do the trick
You will not need any beasts of the land
And only one human will provide a helping hand
Three you desire, all in a line
The last is a powder, from pressure and time
To make the elixir add the neighbors and stir well, clockwise
Next, add the liquid and bubbles shall arise
The last ingredient you must sprinkle, then mix it around
Concoction complete! Now drink it down.
Once consumed, the circle you must enter
And appear in the chamber of the mage always remembered.
