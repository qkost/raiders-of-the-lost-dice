#### Potion Brewing
**The instructions:**

For those who desire power or a bit of fun,
An assortment lies before you, five you must shun.
To start the brew, neither end you should pick
Second inside, only one will do the trick
You will not need any creatures of the land
And only one plant will provide a helping hand
Three you desire, all in a line
The last is a powder, grown in water brine
To make the elixir add the neighbors and stir well, clockwise
Next, add the liquid and bubbles shall arise
The last ingredient you must sprinkle, then mix it around
Concoction complete! Now time to drink it down.
