## Legend Lore

You are cast into an era where the battle between celestial light and infernal darkness rages across Exandria. You witness a figure of vigilance and truth, Bariel, a Deva of Erathis, clad in the Armor of the Valiant Soul. Her wings, uninhibited due to the flexible construction of the armor, cut through the air; a streak of divine light against the shadow. Through the armor she commands powers to heal with a cleansing light and to unveil truth hidden by deceipt.

Suddenly, the sky darkens, and from that void emerges a dragon of such immense power that its very presence weaves shadows into the sky. The air trembles with the clash of holy light against the darkened silver scales as Bariel confronts this harbinger of doom. Embolded by the armor's aura, allies rally by her side, their courage resolute.

In a final act, Bariel charges the dragon, only to be enveloped by its darkness. As the vision dims, we see her stand come to an end, and with it, the Armor of the Valiant Soul is claimed by the dragon and sequestered away in its hoard.

The scene shifts, bringing you to the land of Strathfell, once a vibrant forest, now a petrified echo of its former self located on the shores of the Miscath Strand. Verdant life has succumbed to blight of the dragon Karketh, The Sable Despoiler, transforming it into a realm of grayscale shadows and twisted, petrified trees. Amongst this desolation, shadowy creatures roam, and the last of the natural inhabitants mount a fading resistance to the encroaching darkness of the Shadowfell.

Deeper still, you are drawn to a lair where light fears to tread, a corrupted tower turned into a spire of despair by Karketh's will. Within its heart, amidst a trove of treasures dimmed by the dragon's shadow, the Armor of the Valiant Soul lies in wait. Its divine essence, muted but undiminished, a silent call to those who would dare to reclaim its power and restore the balance of light.
