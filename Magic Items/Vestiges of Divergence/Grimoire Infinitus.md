* Lore
	* A massive mountain floating in the sky surrounded by a city -- Avalir, the City of Crowns
	* A elven woman in a library recording all her thoughts and knowledge

	* Fire, devastation; the city falls
	* The woman seals the tome in a protective field
	* The red form, Asmodeus, crushes the city as it hits the earth; splitting the continent into a chain of small islands
	* Elemental fire and earth emerges from the depths below the land
	* The book remains in a crater of circling water; floating pillars of earth surrounded by what is left of the city protected by this barrier

	* Moving islands of shattered teeth orbiting large 'whirlpool'
	* Floating pieces of earth, raw elemental energy
