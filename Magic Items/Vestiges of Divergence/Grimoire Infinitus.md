## Legend Lore

You are transported to a time the arcane pursuits of mortals rivaled the power of the gods. Avalir, the City of Crowns, a floating metropolis on a mountain. It's a sight of unparalleled beauty, a testament to what once was.

You see an elven woman craft a tomb and through her lifetime imbue that book with everything she has ever learned and all the knowledge of the age. While wielding it, she has access to an increased number and a wide array of spells and has the ability to modify them in both subtle and powerful ways. The tomb's mastery of magic grants her unparalleled ability to resist and ocun

But the hubris of this age brought about its own end. A tree, ancient beyond measure, its branches adorned with glowing runes, splits open. From its heart emerges a form of impossible beauty and terror, horns red as blood; the betrayer God walks Exandria. His arrival heralds chaos and the beginning of the Calamity. Fire rains from the sky, and the once-floating paradise descends into catastrophe, its fall marking the end of an era. With a cataclysmic roar, Avalir crashes to the continent of Domunus, the impact splintering the land into a myriad of isolated islands.

In the eye of this storm, amidst the ruin, an elven woman, her face a mask of determination and sorrow, enacts a spell of preservation. A field of protective energy envelops a book, her life's work, suspended in time and shielded from the devastation that consumes the world.

The vision shifts, and you now stand amidst the aftermath. The shattered remnants of Avalir are a landscape transformed â€” islands of jagged earth orbit a maelstrom, floating chunks of land hang suspended in a dance with gravity, surrounded by elemental fury. The city, though in ruins, breathes with the echo of ancient magics, guarded by automatons whose eyes glow with a fierce, blue light, their runic claws ready to defend against intruders.

At the heart of this chaos, the Grimoire Infinitus waits, its pages filled with an uncountable number spells and incantations. A mage could spend endless lifetimes flipping through its pages. To wield this tome is to touch the essence of magic itself, a promise of knowledge and power that spans the ages.
