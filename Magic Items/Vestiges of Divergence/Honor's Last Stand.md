## Legend Lore

A vision unfurls before you, sweeping you into the heart of an ancient battlefield, the air thick with roiling breath of dragons, both metallic and chromatic. A dragonborn figure emerges, a shining champion of Bahamut, their name lost to time. They stand alone, the embodiment of valor, wielding Honor's Last Stand, a shield aglow with celestial fire, during the fateful Battle of Ghor Dranas.

A great red wyrm blasts this champion, who stands undaunted, their shield absorbing the dragons' elemental wrath and casting it back in a brilliant counterstrike. But wave after wave of foe finally felled the hero. In the aftermath of the battle only jagged spires of rock remain as silent sentinels over a unmarked grave.

Centuries pass, and the shield's journey through the hands of time is fraught with greed and betrayal, passing from looter to merchant, stolen and sold, until it finds its rest in the hands of the Barbed Ruin.

Your vision shifts, transporting you to the City of Brass, a marvel of the Plane of Fire. Its towering edifices and sweeping minarets, all crafted from gleaming hot brass. Here, among the grandeur of efreet and the crossroads of worlds, lies the mansion of the Barbed Ruin, a stronghold of luxury and power, its halls patrolled by devils, its rooms guarded by efreeti.

Within this mansion, in an office that drips with wealth and authority, the shield—Honor's Last Stand—hangs upon the wall, a trophy of conquest, its surface still echoing with the courage and sacrifice of its fallen wielder.

Standing before it, in military regalia adorned with the medals of countless victories, is the Barbed Ruin himself. With purple skin and bat-like wings, he exudes a command of the battlefield that belies the ceremonial nature of his rapier. Yet, even he cannot deny the silent call of the shield, a beckoning to those whose hearts are brave enough to bear its weight and legacy.

As the vision fades, leaving the echoes of battle in its wake, the path forward is clear: to claim Honor's Last Stand is not just to wield a weapon of immense power, but to carry on the legacy of a champion who stood valiant against the darkness, a beacon of hope and defiance in a world that teeters on the brink of despair.
