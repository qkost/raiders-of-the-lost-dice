## Legend Lore

Looming thousands of feet tall, the primordial empress of earth, Ka'Mort, faced off against the prime deities themselves. Amidst this elemental chaos, a figure stands resolute: Dyamak, a warrior monk whose mastery over the elements was unparalleled. With movements as fluid as the rivers and strikes as forceful as the earth itself, Dyamak faced this incursion alongside the gods, his hands wrapped in bands of power, the very essence of the elements woven into their fabric.

As the turmoil of the Calamity subsided, Dyamak retreated into meditation, his spirit eventually merging with the elements he had so fiercely protected. The wraps, imbued with his essence and strength, were thought lost to time, until unearthed in the underdark by a colony of mindflayers. Seeking to appease a magnificent dragon made of purple-amethyst gems, the mind flayers offered the wraps as a token of peace.

The Wraps of Dyamak, possess abilities that echo the legend of their original master. The wearer's fists can swell into massive boulders, delivering blows with the weight of mountains. Water heeds their call, extending outward to grapple and ensnare. Flames dance from their palms, immolating foes at a distance. In moments of serenity, the wielder can ascend on gusts of wind, a testament to the air's gentle embrace.

Your vision then takes you to the present, to the Stonecage cliffs, where Zunda'i-Miir, the dragon whose scales sparkle like amethyst, resides. Her lair, a cathedral of geodes hidden within a complex tunnel system near the surface, cradles her hoard. For centuries, Zunda'i-Miir has known peace, her presence a harmonious part of the cliffs' tapestry. Yet, a restless agitation now stirs her, her actions becoming unpredictable and fierce, a stark departure from the harmony she once embodied.
