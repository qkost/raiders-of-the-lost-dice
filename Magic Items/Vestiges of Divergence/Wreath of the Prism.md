## Legend Lore

You vision is pulled back to see a pale, slender, sulken Archfey, Daemoth, weave his essence into a loop of golden thorns -- The Wreath of the Prism. With this circlet, he bends the will of those around him to his chaotic desires, manipulating the whimsical and cruel denizens of the Feywild

Daemoth's ambitions swelled, compelling him to pour more of his essence into the wreath, aiming to beguile and ensnare even his peers within the fey court. His hubris, however, was his undoing as he was exiled, banished from the realm. The Wreath of the Prism, is bestowed upon Zathuda, Sorrow Lord and Grove Captain of the Unseelie Court, wielding the sword of the Lightless Flame.

The Wreath of the Prism holds the power to dominate the minds of beasts, dragons, and monstrosities, bending these formidable beings to the wearer's will, a testament to its creator's unchecked ambition and the dangers of power unmoored from wisdom.

Your vision shifts, transporting you to a land ensnared in eternal winter's grasp. Here lies Shiver Keep, a fortress of ice and sadness, its towers and spires standing as silent sentinels in the still air. Guarded by elven warriors clad in jagged armor and patrolled by beasts with faces as vacant as the void, it is a realm of frozen beauty and lurking danger.

Mounted on the fey drake he dominates, Zathuda, surveys his domain with eyes like frozen lakes. He patrols the skies for the joy of the hunt, a predator in a land of perpetual frost.
