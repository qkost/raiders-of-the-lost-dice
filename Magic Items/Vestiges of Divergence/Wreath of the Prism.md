## Legend Lore

You vision is pulled back to see a slender, sulken Archfey, Daemoth, weave his essence into a loop of golden thorns -- The Wreath of the Prism. With this circlet, he bends the will of those around him to his chaotic desires, manipulating the whimsical and cruel denizens of the Feywild

Daemoth's ambitions swelled, compelling him to pour more of his essence into the wreath, aiming to beguile and ensnare even his peers within the fey court. His hubris, however, is his undoing. For this transgression, he is exiled, banished from his realm. The Wreath of the Prism, now a symbol of overreach and exile, is bestowed upon Zathuda, Sorrow Lord and Grove Captain of the Unseelie Court, a figure draped in the shadow of the Lightless Flame.

The Wreath of the Prism holds the power to dominate the minds of beasts, dragons, and monstrosities, bending these formidable beings to the wearer's will, a testament to its creator's unchecked ambition and the dangers of power unmoored from wisdom.

Your vision shifts, transporting you to a land ensnared in eternal winter's grasp. Here lies Shiver Keep, a fortress of ice and despair, its towers and spires standing as silent sentinels in the stillness. Guarded by elven warriors clad in jagged armor and patrolled by beasts with faces as vacant as the void, it is a realm of frozen beauty and lurking danger.

Atop a green fey dragonoid, Zathuda, now the wreath's master, surveys his domain with eyes like frozen lakes. In his hand, a sword of black fire cuts through the chill air, a dark beacon in the twilight. He patrols the skies not in defense, but for the twisted joy of the hunt, a predator in a land of perpetual frost.

The vision fades, leaving you with the echo of Zathuda's cold laughter, a reminder of the wreath's power to dominate and the icy solitude of those who wield it. To seek the Wreath of the Prism is to venture into the heart of winter's desolation, to confront the twisted fealty it inspires, and to decide whether to bear its burden or break its cycle of domination.
