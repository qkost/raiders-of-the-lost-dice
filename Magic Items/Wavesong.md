# Wavesong (Concertina)


Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement by a Bard)

An instrument of the bards is an exquisite example of its kind, superior to an ordinary instrument in every way. A creature that attempts to play the instrument without being attuned to it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 2d4 psychic damage.
    
You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one of its spells if you have the spellcasting ability to cast a spell at that level: [Wall of Water](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/wall-of-water), [Blur](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/blur), [Gust of Wind](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/gust-of-wind), [Protection from Poison](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/protection-from-poison), [Create or Destroy Water](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/create-or-destroy-water), [Ice Knife](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/ice-knife), [Fog Cloud](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/fog-cloud). Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can’t be used to cast that spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your spellcasting ability and spell save DC.

You can play the instrument while casting a spell that causes any of its targets to be [charmed](https://www.dndbeyond.com/compendium/rules/basic-rules/appendix-a-conditions#Charmed) on a failed saving throw, thereby imposing disadvantage on the save. This effect applies only if the spell has a somatic or a material component.

## Note

Hand-written note:

> This instrument found me and helped bring me out of a dark time in my life. My need for it has passed, and while it saddens me to part with it, I hope you find its music provides you that same strength it given me throughout the years.
