*Wondrous Item, Uncommon*

This simple rod can transform into a variety of other weapon types; as an action, you can touch the item and transform it into any type of weapon of your choice as long as it lacks the "ammunition" property (see the "[Equipment](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb/equipment#Weapons)" chapter in the _[Player's Handbook](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/phb)_ for a list of weapons). Whatever form the weapon takes, you are proficient with it.

While holding the weapon, you can use an action to cast the [light](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/light) spell but the target can only be this weapon.
