## Discord Downtime

**TL;DR:** I need two things from you by Saturday night (preferably earlier so I can message back and forth with you if required):
1. Choice of downtime activity
2. Feat choice

Hi everyone! As mentioned at the end of the session on Discord, I plan for a few weeks of downtime when you get to Darktow both for the pacing of the adventure and to allow some more character development/customization.

I plan on pretty much using the options in [Xanathar's Guide to Everything Downtime Activities](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/xgte/downtime-revisited#DowntimeActivities). If you don't have this book, it isn't necessary. If you want to read the section, you should have access if you are logged in and [create a character in my campaign](https://www.dndbeyond.com/campaigns/join/4165526382691014) (everyone has done this except Ember). You don't have to actually create a character, just making a L1 blank character is fine to get access.

I'll summarize the downtime activity options here:
* Buy a Magic Item - spend time to find sellers of various items
* Carousing - try and make connections/gain influence
* Crafting an Item - make some stuff if you have proficiency in relevant tools (e.g. Smith's tools)
* Brew potions of healing - if you have herbalism kit
* Crime/Gambling/Pit Fighting/Work - try and steal/gamble/fight/work to make money
* Relaxation
* Scribing as Spell Scroll - if you have proficiency in arcana, you can spend some time and gold to write spell scrolls for spells you know
* Selling magic items - find a good buyer for expensive items
* Training - learn a language or pick up a proficiency with a tool. 

In addition to these downtime activities, you can choose one feat that you can train in during this time. I encourage the feat to be ones that add variety/flavor to your character rather than pure combat prowess. Non-exhaustive list of examples:
* Encouraged feats: Actor, Athlete, Chef, Martial Adept, Magic Initiate (for variety rather than pure power), Skilled, Skill Expert
* Discouraged feats: Crossbow Expert, Sharpshooter, Great Weapon Master, Polearm Master, War Caster, Lucky

Please let me know what you would like to do with your downtime and what your feat choice is Saturday night so I can prepare on Sunday. This hopefully isn't too much work and is fun!

## Creating a Spell

Hi Brittany! In lieu of the downtime activities, I was thinking there is one additional option for Ember. I saw that in [one of the playests](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/one-dnd/ph-playtest5/owThVp1CESZ1c91y/UA-2023-PH-Playtest5.pdf) they were messing around with giving wizards the ability to customize their own spells. I thought that was amazing as there is nothing more wizardy than creating new spells (e.g. "Archeron's Necrotic Blast" or something).

I thought some of the options were overpowered, but most of them seemed pretty fine. Here's a rough version of what I was thinking is reasonable:
