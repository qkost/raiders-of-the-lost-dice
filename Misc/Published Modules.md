## Curse of Strahd

* Setting
	* Gothic horror
	* Vampires
* *Under raging storm clouds, the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich stands silhouetted against the ancient walls of Castle Ravenloft. Rumbling thunder pounds the castle spires. The wind’s howling increases as he turns his gaze down toward the village of Barovia. Far below, yet not beyond his keen eyesight, a party of adventurers has just entered his domain. Strahd’s face forms the barest hint of a smile as his dark plan unfolds. The master of Castle Ravenloft is having guests for dinner. And you are invited.*
* L1-10

* Setting:
	* Exandria
* Fairly linear
* *The greed of mortals has awakened a powerful entity long thought destroyed. For eons, this mighty champion of the gods has been imprisoned in the darkest depths of Exandria. His name has been forgotten, as have his heroic deeds. Languishing in despair, he calls out for new heroes to save him.*
* Description
	* Rival party
	* Starts in traditional 'monstrous race' area where goblins/drow are the norm
	* Some seafaring
* L3-12
