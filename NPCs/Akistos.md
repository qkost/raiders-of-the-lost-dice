## Contract

Contract of Infernal Obligation  
  
This contract binds the scribe and recipient into a deal of chosen escalation for an unending period of time, or this contract is voided by an agreement on the part of both parties. 
  
This contract as a whole remains until the predetermined period of eternity, allowing the recipient, should they feel inclined, to invoke and trigger the first or second pact any time thereafter through written acceptance on the indicated signatory lines. The obligations and parameters agreed upon within the first or second pact then become binding and immediate, to be fulfilled on part of both parties. Upon completion of the agreed obligations and parameters on both sides of the first or second pact, that pact is considered complete and concluded. This contract remains in effect through all pacts and thereafter, maintaining any agreed-upon specifications and obligations that remain outside of a pact's completion, for eternity.

Any attempt to harm the scribe or recipient 
  
Any violation of this contract on the part of the scribe immediately holds this contract null and void, requiring a penalty payment of 100,000 gold pieces to the recipient to be paid immediately. Any violation of this contract on the part of the recipient immediately locks the claim and ownership of the everlasting soul of the recipient, invoking the laws of the pact primeval, under the control and dominance of the scribe for all of eternity, sending the soul of the recipient immediately upon death to the scribe to do with as they see fit. After any violation of this contract, any attempt to subvert death on behalf of the recipient, through immortality, undeath, resurrection magic, or other means, will result in the immediate forfeiture of the soul of the recipient to the scribe.  

FIRST PACT  
  
The scribe, (signature burned away), agrees to immediately bestow upon the recipient an Epic Boon which will last until the recipient's death. One (1) Epic Boon is selected by the recipient from the following options:
- Boon of Combat Prowess
- Boon of Dimensional Travel
- Boon of Energy Resistance
- Boon of Fate
- Boon of Irresistible Offense
- Boon of Speed
- Boon of Spell Recall
- Boon of the Night Spirit
- Boon of Truesight

The recipient(s) agree to obtain a "Tear of Desirat" deliver it without tampering to the scribe within one Catha month of signing this contract.

SECOND PACT  
  
The scribe, (signature burned away), agrees to grant the recipient extreme powers that could otherwise only be achieved through years of dedicated experience. This power shall be equivalent of three tiers of combat prowess and shall last until the recipient's death.  

The recipient(s) agree to desecrate a three holy sites chosen by the scribe, creating a planar rift connecting the Nine Hells of Baator to each holy site, with power granted by the scribe, within one Catha month of invoking this pact. Any failure to desecrate these sites or interference after desecration, directly or indirectly, will be considered a violation of this contract.
