_Chaotic good, female human_

Known to many as the “Screaming Knuckle,” Alyson is the loud and joyful captain of the ship The Ill Hand who enjoys a good brawl as much as she appreciates a stiff drink. Paij took to piracy because of her hatred for the [[Clovis Concord]]. She does her best to rein in [[The Revelry]]’s cruelest captains and focus their efforts on those who deserve to have their goods stolen.
