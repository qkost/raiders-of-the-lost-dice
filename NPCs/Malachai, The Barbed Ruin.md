## Contract

**Contract of Infernal Obligation**

This contract binds the scribe and recipient into a deal of chosen escalation for an unending period of time, or this contract is voided by an agreement on the part of both parties. Upon agreeing to and signing this contract, the recipient is bound to their agreed obligations and parameters within the first pact, as is the scribe. Upon completion of the agreed obligations and parameters on both sides of the initial pact, the first pact is considered complete and concluded.

This contract as a whole remains until the predetermined period of eternity, allowing the recipient, should they feel inclined, to invoke and trigger the second or third pact any time thereafter through verbal acceptance in relative proximity of this contract. The obligations and parameters agreed upon within the second or third pact then become binding and immediate, to be fulfilled on part of the both parties. Upon completion of the agreed obligations and parameters on both sides of the second or third pact, that pact is considered complete and concluded. This contract remains in effect through all pacts and thereafter, maintaining any agreed upon specifications and obligations that remain outside of a pact's completion, for eternity.

Any willful attempt to harm* the recipient or the scribe, directly or indirectly, is considered a violation of contract. Any violation of this contract on the part of the scribe immediately holds this contract null and void, requiring a penalty payment of 100,000 gold pieces to the recipient to be paid immediately. Any violation of this contract on the part of the recipient immediately locks the claim and ownership of the everlasting soul of the recipient, invoking the laws of the pact primeval, under the control and dominance of the scribe for all of eternity, sending the soul of the recipient immediately upon death to the scribe to do with as they see fit. After any violation of this contract, any attempt to subvert death on behalf of the recipient, through immortality, undeath, resurrection magic, or other means will result the immediate forfeiture of the soul of the recipient to the scribe to do with as they see fit.

* Harm in this context includes violent action, bodily harm, imprisonment, or other means of removal of power or agency outside the agreed upon terms of this contract.

**FIRST PACT**

The scribe, **Malachai**, agrees to bestow upon the recipient a magical item known as "Honor's Last Stand" and enable safe passage of the recipient and up to three additional creatures of the recipient's choice to the material plane within one day of signing this contract.

The recipient, ___________________, agrees to procure a "Tear of Desirat" for Malachai and deliver it without delay or tampering within one month of signing this contract.

**SECOND PACT**

The scribe, **Malachai**, agrees to conjure forth a cadre of lesser devils in service to the recipient, who shall remain under the command of and dedicated to the protection of the recipient for the duration of 1 month. The cadre shall include two imps, two hamatula and a single osyluth. Should any devils bound within this agreed upon cadre be slain outside of Baator, they are absolved of future service to the recipient.

The recipient, ___________________, agrees to desecrate three holy sites chosen by Malachai, creating a planar rift connecting the Nine Hells of Baator to each holy site with power granted by Malachai, within one month of invoking this pact. Any interference or failure to desecrate these sites will be considered a violation of this contract.

**THIRD PACT**

The scribe, **Malachai**, agrees to grant the recipient a wish, as per the spell "Wish," fulfilling their deepest desire. The wish cannot be used to alter or nullify this contract. Any attempt to use this wish to subvert the contract is a violation of the contract and the wish
