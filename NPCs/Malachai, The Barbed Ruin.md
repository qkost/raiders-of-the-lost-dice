## Contract

**Contract of Infernal Obligation**

This contract binds the scribe and recipient into a deal of chosen escalation for an unending period of time, or this contract is voided by an agreement on the part of both parties. Upon agreeing to and signing this contract, the recipient is bound to their agreed obligations and parameters within the first pact, as is the scribe. Upon completion of the agreed obligations and parameters on both sides of the initial pact, the first pact is considered complete and concluded.

This contract as a whole remains until the predetermined period of eternity, allowing the recipient, should they feel inclined, to invoke and trigger the second or third pact any time thereafter through verbal acceptance in relative proximity of this contract. The obligations and parameters agreed upon within the second or third pact then become binding and immediate, to be fulfilled on part of the both parties. Upon completion of the agreed obligations and parameters on both sides of the second or third pact, that pact is considered complete and concluded. This contract remains in effect through all pacts and thereafter, maintaining any agreed upon specifications and obligations that remain outside of a pact's completion, for eternity.

Any harm or violent action on performed by, or on behalf of, the recipient or the scribe towards the other is considered a breach of contract. Any violation of this contract on the part of the scribe immediately holds this contract null and void, requiring a penalty payment of 15,000 gold pieces to the recipient to be paid immediately. Any violation of this contract on the part of the recipient immediately locks the claim and ownership of the everlasting soul of the recipient, invoking the laws of the pact primeval, under the control and dominance of the scribe for all of eternity, sending the soul of the recipient immediately upon death to the scribe to do with as they see fit.

**FIRST PACT**

The scribe, **Malachai**, agrees to bestow upon the recipient a magic item known as "Honor's Last Stand."

The recipient, ___________________, agrees to steal a "Tear of Desirat" for Malachai and deliver it without delay or tampering within one month of signing this contract.

**SECOND PACT**

The scribe, **Malachai**, agrees to conjure forth a cadre of lesser devils in service to the recipient, who shall remain under the command of and dedicated to the protection of the recipient for the duration of 1 month. The cadre shall include four imps and a single bearded devil. Should any devils bound within this agreed upon cadre be slain outside of Baator, they are absolved of future service to the recipient.

The recipient, ___________________, agrees to desecrate three holy sites chosen by Malachai, creating a planar rift connecting the Nine Hells of Baator to each holy site with power granted by Malachai, within one month of invoking this pact. Any interference or failure to desecrate these sites will be considered a violation of this contract.

**THIRD PACT**

The scribe, **Malachai**, agrees to grant the recipient a wish, as per the spell "Wish," fulfilling their deepest desire. The wish cannot be used to alter or nullify this contract, nor can it be used to harm or undermine the power or position of the scribe.

The recipient, ___________________, agrees to immediately lock the claim and ownership of their everlasting soul, invoking the laws of the pact primeval, under the control and dominance of the scribe for all of eternity, sending the soul of the recipient immediately upon death to the scribe to do with as they see fit.
