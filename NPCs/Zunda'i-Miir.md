## Motivation

* Amethyst dragons pay particular attention to intrusions of the Far Realm into the Material Plane. They loathe the corruption that accompanies such intrusions into the world, making them fierce opponents of the Far Realm and any creatures warped by its touch.

## History


* During the Calamity, the Betrayers ripped open portals to the outer planes and, intentionally or otherwise, also narrowed the gap between the material plane and the far realm. This enabled aberrations to enter the world [[Zunda'i-Miir]]'s mission was to fight back against these forces of the Far Realm and creatures warped by its touch.

## Lair

* ***Crystal Profusion.** Amethyst crystals and geodes form along muddy shores and lake beds within 6 miles of the lair.
* **Thriving Wildlife.** Fish and other aquatic Beasts reproduce rapidly and thrive in bodies of water within 6 miles of the lair. Foraging in these waters yields twice the usual amount of food.
* **Watery Sight.** Water within 6 miles of the lair is a conduit for the dragonâ€™s psionic presence. As an action, the dragon can cast the [clairvoyance](https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/clairvoyance) spell, requiring no spell components and targeting any body of water in that region.
