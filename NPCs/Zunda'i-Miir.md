* Ancient [Amethyst dragon](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/ftod/bestiary#AmethystDragons)
	* Amethyst dragons, the mightiest of the gem dragons, study and psionically manipulate the fundamental principles of the multiverse, from the force of gravity to the emanations of the Outer Planes. Their innate psionics give them a measure of control over how physical laws affect them. They defy gravity with flight that doesnâ€™t rely solely upon their great wings, and gravitational force empowers both their devastating breath weapon and the exploding amethyst crystals they spit at their foes.

* Horde contains [[Wraps of Dyamak]]
* Lair in Stonecage Cliffs

* Motivation
	* Amethyst dragons pay particular attention to intrusions of the Far Realm into the Material Plane. They loathe the corruption that accompanies such intrusions into the world, making them fierce opponents of the Far Realm and any creatures warped by its touch.
* History
	* During the Calamity, the Betrayers ripped open portals to the outer planes and, intentionally or otherwise, also narrowed the gap between the material plane and the far realm. This enabled aberrations to enter the world [[Zunda'i-Miir]]'s mission was to fight back against these forces of the Far Realm and creatures warped by its touch.

Possible conflict with [[Shadowclaw]] as he's an aberrant mind sorcerer?
