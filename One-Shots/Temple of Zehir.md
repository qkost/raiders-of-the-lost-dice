## Introduction

Welcome back to the world of Exandria! Since last we left off our adventurers set off in search of gold, adventure, and whatever else their hearts' desire. Their travels have taken them south past Alfield and Trostenwald and through the Wuyun gates; departing their familiar Dwendalian Empire home and entering Menagerie Coast; a lush, rain-swept, tropical region filled with scattered forests and jungles, rocky seaside cliffs and beaches, overgrown islands, and bustling trade routes that traverse the perilous Lucidian Ocean.

After a quick stop in the colorful city of Nicodranas, the party spent some time in Feolinn enjoying their wine and ciders with are renowned throughout Exandria.

One evening in Feolinn, our heroes stumbled upon some reports of people gone missing up the Sennefel River to the east. Rumors claim that mysterious figures have been spotted near the [Ki'Nau](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/egtw/story-of-wildemount#TheKiNau) ruins at the base of the Cyrios Mountains. You decided to pursue this mystery.

After a 4 day trek from Feolinn, you find yourselves in a pleasant river valley. The cerulean waters of the Sennefel river are bounded by steep limestone cliffs topped with Mediterranean foliage.

At last, you spot in the distance a massive stone statue of a warrior, towering at least 50 feet tall. The passage of time has stained, cracked, and broken much its exterior, but it continues to stand, an imposing sentinel over the valley.

You believe you've now found your destination.
