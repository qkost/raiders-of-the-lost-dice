N,


My congratulations on locating the item. Your effectiveness has not gone unnoticed. Please thank A.P. for her assistance discovering the shipment from the Teeth.


You'll be joined shortly by a representative of our customer to retrieve it. These fanatics are not to be trusted, but you and I both know what this haul can do for us at this time.


Speaking of our customer, we've been looking into the Flames' activity which has ramped up significantly in recent months. It's been difficult to track their movements as they cover their tracks well, working mostly through intermediaries.


All we have discovered so far is an excavation they've funded east of the Call and rumored activity along the lines near Talonstadt. Where did they get these resources? They must be well-connected or well-funded, but I have nothing but conjecture at this time. The Kricks? C.A.? Please report any new information you discover.


Our lack of awareness disturbs me. Proceed with the upmost caution.

-I.B.
