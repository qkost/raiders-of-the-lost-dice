## Copy/Pasta

1. Ember Archeron, Ph. D. is a Tiefling Necromancer, Archaeologist, and Linguist. Born to human parents, her mother died in childbirth, setting her on her lifelong quest to raise the dead with ancient magic in the hopes that they could one day meet. Despite her infernal heritageâ€”the demonic bloodline must have been from her motherâ€™s sideâ€”her father raised her to be more precocious than is typically deemed appropriate. He and Ember were quite close and shared a love of ruins, puzzles, riddles, verb tenses, etc. A renowned history professor himself, Dr. Archeron (Sr.) taught for many years at Soltryce Academy until his recent ~mysterious~ death. Emberâ€™s burning questions and confusion around her fatherâ€™s death (was he murdered??) has only emboldened her quest for necromantic answers. She recently obtained grant funding to research ruins from the Age of Arcanum, with the expectation that she publish her findings and present at the conference in two years. Ember is definitely booksmart, although sheâ€™s too well-travelled to be considered completely inept at most things. As a tiefling, sheâ€™s prone to fiery bouts of temper and frustration, but otherwise sheâ€™s perfectly civilized and content to unravel dead languagesâ€™ idioms. She loves spicy foods and is prone to motion sickness.

    Please let me know if any of this is not okay or needs tweaking! We can talk about the circumstances around Emberâ€™s fatherâ€™s death if you want that to develop as a plot hook. You can reveal as much or as little as youâ€™d like.

    And let me know if you have any questionsâ€¦Iâ€™m excited!

Iâ€™m thinking my father was aware of the necromancy, he didnâ€™t study it as hard as I did but he certainly understood my interest in reviving my mother. He wouldâ€™ve explained the social censorship, but I think privately he entertained (and sometimes enabled) my ideas. His first name was Petyr (Pete). I donâ€™t feel like he was rubbing elbows with the top wizards in the world. I mean he was probably published in a few journals and maybe had a book or two but he was content with teachingâ€¦or at least, as far as Ember knows. ![ðŸ‘€](https://discord.com/assets/4c5a77a89716352686f590a6f014770c.svg) I can be from Rexxentrum. I was really trying not to read too much, I just picked Zemnian as a language based on a short description that itâ€™s often associated with the age of arcanum. Iâ€™m thinking her father is her primary mentor but for the sake of rounding out the character, we can say that Ember has kept a long, very secretive correspondence about necromancy with Dr. April Moors (based on my fave professor irl lol). I respect her greatly but have not seen her in years. The feat I took is Linguist, which buffed my INT by 1 and gave me three more languages. I think publicly, Ember is most accomplished as a linguist/historian and she tells people sheâ€™s school of enchantment (? Not final in thisâ€¦but we can keep the necromancy under wraps).
