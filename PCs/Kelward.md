## Copy/Paste

Kelward (Molsha)
	Family:
		Mother: Ellena Molsha - Genasi
			22 when Kelward was born
			38 when she died
			Worked as a weaver when she could get that work, warehouse worker when she could not
			Died young of some pneumonia-like disease
		Father: ??? Escalado - Human
			32 when Kelward was born
			Died "mysteriously" before he was born (mother wouldn't talk about it, crime-related?)
		Half-Sister: Paula Escalado - Human
			Kelward has only met her ~4-5 times
			16 years older than Kelward
			Last he knew, she was working in trade/finance, looking to move up in the world

	Hometown: Port Zoon

Timeline:
	Early life (0 - 15)
		Born a few weeks after his father died, never learned why or really much about his father at all.  No longer remembers his first name
		Grew up poor-ish but healthy. Took small but honest jobs in his youth
		Mother died of a unlucky illness when he was 16. Could probably have saved her life if they were better off, but also maybe not
		Couldn't afford rent for long (3 months) and couldn't survive off the generosity of others for much longer than that (2 months)

	Fisherman's Life (15 - 17)
		Decided there was nothing left in Port Zoon so he took the job that would pay the most money the quickest, manual labor on fishing vessels
		Never became much more than a deckhand, travelled all around the Menagerie Coast and Swavain Islands
		Occasionally took other jobs, but mainly stuck to fishing, etc.  Made good money, saved most by not putting down roots

Last Fishing Vessel: Yours Always
	Attacked by pirates, Kelward never saw any of these people again (didn't know them well anyway, just a job)

	Lightning Strikes (17)
		One trip out, they hit a particularly productive patch, high quality fish, etc.
		Captain decided to dump the catch ASAP to maximize profits, but the location was not great, attracted pirate attention immediately
		Pirates tracked the ship down a short ways off of land and boarded, but this was noticed by Concorde ships
		Stalemate occurred, eventually the pirates took several hostages to ensure their safe exit
			Kelward
			Marya Tolsta - Human woman (18)
			Embo Stonetoe - Dwarven man (80 "middle aged")
			Kharish - Tiefling woman (19)
			Others...

Ship: Blue Miranda
	Captain: Abner Rhora - Human man (58 when met)
		Ruthless in his ambition, but good to those who serve him.
		"It be only half as good to swing your sword as to threaten the thing"
		He's a very successful pirate, should be more famous
			There's something in his past that keeps him at arm's length from the rest of the Revelry, Kelward never learned what
	First-Mate: Kampo Kesh - Half-elf man (30 when met)
		Unbelievable hard-ass, drives the crew much harder than Rhora
		Clearly ambitious, plain dislike for anyone reaching above their station from below him
	Quartermaster: [[Tosh Caro]] - Half-Orc woman (21)
		Extremely capable sailor, not very personable
		Can be bought at almost any price, as long as it's more than any other offer

		A Pirate's Life (17 - 22)
			Most of the hostages are released on some random, remote island after a few weeks, but Captain Rhora gives a few the opportunity to stay, if they choose
			Those named above choose to stay
				Kelward, Marya, and Kharish train as deckhands, lookouts, and learn the "fine art" of combat
				Embo works to become botswain, eventually settles in as a cook. Fills in as a surgeon when the crew can't afford a real one
			Life under Captain Rhora is exciting, violent, and profitable. Rhora isn't a fool though, keeps his crew safe enough and only hits vulnerable vessels

		Changing of the Guard (22)
			One day, Captain Rhora picks an unwise target, an enemy vessel disguised as a cargo vessel
				Eventually, all onboard the enemy vessel were killed and they never learned if they were Concorde men or Revelry, much to Kampo's rage
			Ambush was successful, many of the crew were killed, but they prevailed mainly due to the heroics of Rhora, Kampo, and Kharish
			Toward the end of the battle, an enemy almost killed Kharish but for some reason Rhora sacrificed himself for her
				Unclear exactly why, he wasn't a brutal man but self-sacrifice was not in his nature
			The ship survived but Rhora did not, dying later that evening despite Embo's best efforts
			Under unanimous vote, Kampo Kesh became Captain of the Blue Miranda, with [[Tosh]] Caro becoming First Mate

		Dark Clouds (22 - 23)
			The crew sees some pretty bad times, turns out Kesh is not an excellent captain
			Takes bad deals, chooses dangerous targets
				Cycle through crew quickly, some try to steal from the captain, lots of "trials at sea" that amount to murdering new crew member suspected of various crimes
			More dangerous than ever with fewer and fewer rewards
			Eventually, while in port, Kesh kicks [[Tosh]] off of the boat, replacing her with a new First Mate and several "advisors"
			These newcomers are strange and dangerous-seeming, but things start to turn around slowly
				Better deals, Kesh starts having more meetings with Revelry Captains, battles seem to go their way more often
			Eventually, Kesh makes enough money to re-paint and re-name the ship, a generally unpopular move

Ship: Zealot's Tide (for a while, Brineheart)
	Captain: Kampo Kesh (36)
	First-Mate: Tarko Roramas (rho-rA-mas) - Hobgoblin (???)
	Quartermaster: Kharish (25)
	"Advisors":
		Illesh Salana - Drow? (if not, goth High Elf) man (???)
		Mohasha Barkhind - Gnome woman (???)

		Darker Tides (23)
			The crew's luck increases, but the violence of their tactics also increases
			Eventually, Kesh takes to slaughtering the crew of enemy ships, selling the carcas of the vessel for whatever money can be gotten
			Clearly Kesh is being affected by these "advisors", meeting with Revelry crew out at sea goes bad and a fight breaks out
				Devastating for both sides, Kesh is bloodthirsty and Kelward sees the "advisors" in action for the first time
				Terrifying mages, awful stuff
			Tarko takes the Revelry ship back to port to strip and sell along with a good part of the crew

		Mutiny (23)
			Kelward, Marya, Kharish, Embo, and others start to whisper of mutiny
			The danger and bloodshed is too much, plus the outsting of [[Tosh]] and renaming of the ship has left many raw
			Mutiny is foiled, however, when Kharish takes the plans to Kesh and the "advisors"
				Would-be mutineers are taken to the deck and the "advisors" hold a "trial"
				All found guilty, sentenced to death and unceremonious committment to the deep
			Marya is killed right in front of me
			Just before I'm killed by these "advisors", Embo breaks free and manages to smash a lantern on the ground
				The skirmish lasts only seconds, but soon some of the burning oil leaks down and lights a powder barrel or something
			Huge explosion, blasts me into the ocean

		Dreaming of the Deep (23)
			Wake up floating, attached to a piece of wood
			Make it to a populated island, use the small amount of gold on my person to buy a room so I can find work
			First night in a warm bed, I have a vicious nightmare about the mutiny
				Everything happened the same as in real life, except in the final moments before Marya was killed, she looked at me, salty tears streaming down her face and huge, pink pearls in place of her eyes
			When I woke up, there was a large, pink pearl under my pillow

		Fair Winds (23-28)
			Spent the next few years sailing, getting work wherever I could find it
			Eventually realized that a life on the seas was too dangerous (what if I run into Kesh again? etc.), relocated to Port Demali
			~1.5 years on the mainland before starting the campaign
