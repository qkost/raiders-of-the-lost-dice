__Overview__
* Dungeons and Dragons 5e
* Starting level: 3. I think this is a good level where players have solid base abilities (and extra attack for martials) but before super powerful spells start to come online
* Point buy for stats -- I like players being on the same playing field rather than rolling for stats
* The optional rules for multiclassing and feats, are allowed and encouraged
* Free feat at L1 -- I think feats are fun and having an extra slot provides some fun options for character customizaiton

__Restrictions__
* Source books -- officially published WoTC PHB and splatbooks (Player's Handbook, Xanathar's Guide to Everything, and Tasha's Cauldron of Everything) are all allowed
* Official WoTC campain settings books (Eberron, Fizban, Raveloft, Explorer's Guide to Wildemount, etc.) are probably good, but just let me know
* No homebrew or Unearthed Arcana please. I just want to avoid to be the arbiter of what is and isn't okay

__Alignment and Motivations__
* Please make a character that wants to go on an adventure with a group (no loners or characters antagonistic to the party)
* No strictly evil characters -- mostly don't be a dick to other players

__Backstory__
* Please don't focus on backstory until after Session 0 (unless you're okay with some of your effort going out the window)
* I do *plan* on drawing motivation for adventures from PC's backstorys, but please don't expect that we will be able to explore every character's backstory in full
* You may decide at Session 0 that you all have been together for a while or are meeting for the first time
* You can put as much effort into your backstory as you'd like, whether it is a paragraph or a couple of pages. I will be happy to read your backstory and flesh out the details to make it fit within this campaign world
* What is a bit more important to me than backstory is that you make a character that is fun for you to play. Give him/her/them a compelling personality that gets you out of your comfort zone, or some mechanics that enable you to act out an interesting character fantasy

__Setting__
* I plan on using the Exporer's Guide to Wildemount campaign guide for the general setting of the campaign
* I have chosen to do this as I don't really want to have to make up a whole world my first time behind the screen. Wildemount is a setting I am familiar with and feel comfortable fleshing out in our campain
* For the Critical Role lovers/haters -- this campaign will have nothing to do with the liveplay series. I'm simply using the general setting as a backdrop

__Flexibility__
* I want to make sure everybody is playing a character that they like to play!
* Please let me know if you'd like to change anything about your character at any time. This could be as big as switching characters completely or swapping out a feat that isn't as fun as you thought.
* If you would like this change to happen as part of the story, we can try to work it in. If instead you just want to hot-swap, that works too!

__Tweaking and reflavoring__
* Please tweak your class/sublass/feats/spells/abilities to make your character yours
* No mechanical benefits (e.g. changing damage types)

__Group Questions__
* Do you know each other? Is session 1 the story of how you meet?
	* You can still plan characters together that fit in well
* What are some common motivations?
	* Treasure hunters?
	* Bounty hunters?
	* Soldiers
	* Loyal to a common cause?
