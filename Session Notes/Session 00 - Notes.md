## Players
* DM - Quinn
* John
* Brittany
* Sean
* Nick (joining in a few weeks)

## Logistics
* Mondays 5 PM PT/8 PM ET -- is this the best time?
* Chat
	* Discord chat? Seems like there is screen/audio/video sharing
* VTT for maps - heavily considering Owlbear Rodeo
	* Mobile friendly (Roll20 is very clunky)
	* Pretty easy to do basic combat
		* Initiative
		* Grid
		* Tokens
		* Measurement
	* Free (although they have some features locked behind a paywall)
* Missing weeks
	* Probably will cancel with <=2
	* Will continue with 3+?
* 'Final' character sheets to me by Friday?
	* Backstory
	* Passive scores
	* Time to memorize character names
* Plan on doing a story arc (O(10) sessions) or two and then re-assessing where we're at
	* Keep going?
	* Different DM?
	* Different characters?

## Boundaries/Disruptive Topics
* ***Please at any time speak up if something is uncomfortable***
* What topics do you not want to see in the game?
* Quinn
	* Planning on keeping it more LoTR than GoT (no explicit torture, sex, etc.)
	* I probably don't want to roll play flirting with evey tavern-keeper
* Challenging topics that have the potential to come up based on the setting; I have no plans on dealing with these at this point
	* The Nine Hells exist in a hierarchical structure based on slavery
	* Some racism; the Dwendalian Empire is on the brink of war with an organization of dark elves and discriminates against all dark elves because of this

## Gameplay

* Player character death
	* Death is a possibility; there are stakes in your adventures
	* Death is permanent barring resurrection magic (e.g. revivify)
	* Encounter difficulty will (hopefully) be proportional to the intensity of the adventure; but dice are random and balancing is hard
* Share the spotlight
* Share the loot
* Roleplay/combat preferences
* Rolling
	* Preferences for online vs. player choice?
	* Don't cheat
* PvP - try to stay away from it unless explicitly agreed to out of character in advance (i.e. stealing from each other, fighting, etc.)
* Metagaming
	* You know what your characters know
	* Things your character doesn't know
		* Stat blocks of enemies
		* Setting information outside of the sessions (except player backgrounds and additional information upon history/religion checks)
	* Things your character does know
		* Generally abilities of other players; you guys travel together so should have a pretty good idea how your abilities work together
	* Talking during combat; I'm okay with it if:
		1. Nobody is *telling* somebody what to do
		2. It's quick and doesn't extend turn durations
		3. It's something the character could convey relatively simply (doesn't necessarily have to be short in rules speak) and the characters aren't otherwise prevented from communicating
* Milestone vs. EXP
	* I'd rather do milestone so I don't have to keep track of EXP
	* Let me know if it's been a while between level ups!

## House Rules

* Short rests are easy, 10-15 minutes; long rests are harder to come by in a contested setting
* Free feat

## Rulings
* My goal is to be as predictable as possible with rulings
	* As close to RAW as possible
	* I tend to shy away from 'Rule of Cool' as that can feel like the DM giving you the rather than players earning it
* Rule debates
	* Please let me know if you think I get a ruling wrong
		* If it is quick to correct, I will try to do so
		* If it takes a long time to look up/it isn't high stakes I will make a ruling and move on; potentially looking up the rule after the session
* No critical success/critical failure/critical fumbles
	* 20 is only a critical hit on attack rolls
	* A (15 + 9) is better than a (nat 20 + 1)
	* A (nat 1 + 9) passes the DC 10 concentration check

## Setting

* Explorer's Guide to Wildemount campaign guide
	* Not a campaign; it is a setting book
	* I'll probably keep you on the continent of Wildemount for some time so I can use the book!
	* Will likely go to different continents and planes of existence when I feel more comfortable without having a base
* I was thinking of starting in small town near a port city (e.g. Port Damali or Port Zoon) in the Menagerie Coast
	* Trading town with connections to pretty much anywhere you want to go
	* Reasonable spot for a group of adventurers to travel for work
* 

## Characters

* See character build guide
* Start at L3 and level up quickly to 5?
* Power level/min-maxing/optimizing
	* Probably want to be all on the same page one way or the other
	* Don't want anybody to feel overshadowed
	* Well-built characters that pick strong abilities and spells can be fun, but only if everybody is on board
* Flexibility
	* Please feel free to try something new and switch out if you don't like it (class, subclass, spells, feats, etc.)
	* Don't abuse this (e.g. you don't think Wizard is good until level X, so you switch to wizard at that point but play something else earlier on)
* D&D Beyond
	* I have the books available if you want a digital copy
	* You don't have to create them on D&D Beyond, but if you happen to use that tool; let me know so I can invite you to the campaign
