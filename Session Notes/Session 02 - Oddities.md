You witness some people dressed as merchants murder some Zhelezo guards as they were being stopped. You killed two of these would be merchants and incapacitated the third. You then met the lauded Lord Gabriel Rymmer who was grateful for having stopped the theft of a strange tetrahedron he was soon to auction. Lord Rymmer told you to meet him back at the Exalted Collection Auction House the next day as he was interested in hiring you for some work after seeing your skills at work.

After your day, you celebrated with some of your hard-earned gold at the Frothy Tankard in the Larboard Light which the tradition of cheering and drinking every time somebody walked into the bar; this got old quickly. You found somewhat nicer lodging for the night a the nearby Crescent City Lodge.
