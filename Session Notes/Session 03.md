## Recap

Welcome back to the world of Exandria. Last we left off our intrepid heroes was in the City of Port Damali, the Jewel of the Coast. They ventured into a curious magic shop, Arcane Oddities run by the excitable Thaddeus Grimshaw. After purchasing a rave stick and an enchanted rapier, Shadowclaw got his bracers identified; however during the ritual creatures made of shadow, wind, and laughter harried our adventurers who ultimately overcame these monsters by the skin of their teeth. After quabbling with Thaddeus about discounts, we return to our heroes after a short rest and a level up in the market place of the Gilded Esplanade. What would you like to do?
