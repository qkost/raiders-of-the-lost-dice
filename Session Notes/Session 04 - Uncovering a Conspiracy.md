## Recap

Welcome friends back to Exandria in the city of Port Damali. Last we left off our adventurers took up  employment with the owner of the Exalted Collection Auction House, Lord Gabriel Rymmer. You were tasked to:
1. Identify the persons or organizations responsible for the attempted theft of a mysterious purple-amethyst colored tetrahedron
2. Discover the means by which they obtained the item from its secure vault, and
3. If possible bring those responsible to justice

You spent some time tracking down leads from Lord Gabriel, his guards and other employees, and finally via one of the culprits directly, via some sick karate moves, who had been locked away in a prison colloquially known as The Silence.

We return to our heroes enjoying the cheapest of imported whiskey in a parlor known as the Gilded Griffon.

What would you like to do?

## Ambush Plan
* Plan to move a fake item to Lady Thinora
* Lord Rymmer is
	* Letting Thinora know that the visit is moved to tomorrow
	* Is organizing a fake box to transport to where Thinora is at
	* Is employing [[Vigor]] to accompany the item along with the party



## Discovery of [[Moira]]
* Mentioned plans to Moira -- She will go to the myriad
	* Moira gets off at 10:00
* Party tracked Moira
	* Followed her after she left her shift
	* Kelward was stealthy, but Tato tripped over a market stall
	* Kelward and Ember chased in hot pursuit -- ultimately caught Moira hiding after she though she'd lost them
	* Kelward followed Moira to an abandoned warehouse that is co-located with a steam vent
* Party entered steam vent -- end of session

## Brainstorming (Pre-Session)

* Thinora goals:
	* Take item directly
		* Domination of [[Lord Gabriel Rymmer]]
		* Modify memory
		* Illusion
	* Reconnaissance to check out security
		* Identify the object
			* Real identification or fake
			* Probably has books
			* Can she use magic? Will it be in the vault?

* Get an accordion to Kelward
