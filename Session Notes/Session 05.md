## Recap

Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria. Last we left off our intrepid adventurers were continuing their investigation into the attempted theft of a mysterious purple-amethyst colored tetrahedron.

The party visited the now-warry shop owner Thaddeus Grimshaw and learned some more information about an entity potentially involved with the theft, [[Malachai, The Barbed Ruin]] as well as purchased a potion of greater healing.

After stocking up, the group relayed their findings to Lord Rymmer and laid out a plot to potentially root out further pursuers of the crystal. Lord Rymmer agreed the party's wishes to delay Thinora's visit and instead send a decoy across the city to be guarded by the party accompanied by Vigor.

To get the word out about the ruse, our adventurers began a whisper campaign to subtly lure potential thieves into ambushing the decoy. To help spread the rumors, the party sought out the help of Moira and Vigor; however Moira raised suspicions. 

Our heroes then sought to see what Moira was up to and stealthily followed her from the ECAU through the streets of Port Damali until Tato crashed into a market stall catching Moira's attention. Ember and Kelward then sprinted down back alleys to keep up with their fleeing target and ultimately tracked her to an abandoned warehouse. Moira met with a mysterious figure and the pair vanished down one of the steam vents, with the party following shortly.

You now find yourselves many stories below the streets of Port Damali in pitch blackness. The air is hot and stagnant and filled with the smell of refuse. You seem to be in a smooth-walled chamber of some sort of maintenance shaft. The walls and ceiling of the cylindrical tunnel are lined with a seemingly endless weave of brass pipes of varying diameters. You hear the hissing of steam and the sounds of rushing water.

What would you like to do?
