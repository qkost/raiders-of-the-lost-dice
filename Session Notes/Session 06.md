## Recap

Welcome friends to the world of Exandria. Last we left off our intrepid adventurers were delving into the sewers and disused steam vents spanning the extent of Port Damali underground.

After some althletic feats of rope climbing and an intense run-in with a Giant Crocodile, our heroes found their quarry Moira dead; her throat slit ear to ear.

We come back to the seemingly endless darkness, dimly lit by the end of Tato's staff. Steam hisses out small exhaust valves from the brass tubing surrounding the sewer pipes.
