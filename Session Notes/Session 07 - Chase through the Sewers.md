## Recap

Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria! Last we left off our heroes, they continues their exploration of the Port Damali sewers. The party climbed through small tunnels bored through seemingly by hand and encountered a kobold den. The kobolds were collecting tolls and offering it to an idol of a dragon-adjacent statue of a mythological creature known as Charybdis.

Our adventurers refused to pay a toll to pass and instead elected for some karate and a life-threatening battle ensued. After licking their wounds the party took the kobold's treasure and continued into the dark tunnels.

In the next large room, a large statue of a sailor looking through a telescope dominated the scene. Kelward noticed an innocuous marking on the scope indicating that there was a stash. After investigating the stash, a secret compartment was found inside the telescope containing a rolled up black, silk cloth that Ember recognized as magical.
