## Recap

Welcome friends back to Exandria! Last we left off, our intrepid heroes were continuing their journey through the Port Damali sewers. After heading distant whispers, Ember attempted to stealth forward but made just enough noise to alert her quarry. A chase ensued left and right down the corridors, ultimately ending in a room filled with silence. The party effectively dispatched a flamethrower trap without injury and followed the trail back to a [[The Myriad]] hide out. After some incredible perception by Shadowclaw, convincing knocking by Kelward, and quick-thinking turtling the party infiltrated the hide out and dispatched the Myriad inside.

You all now find yourselves in the dug-out stronghold of the Myriad in the Port Damali sewers. You're well aware that any remaining myriad members would be alerted to your presence from the loud noise of the combat that just transpired. What would you like to do?
