## Recap

Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria! Last we left off, our intrepid heroes raided the underground headquarters of the [[The Myriad]] and found some documentation of their activities in the city and connections to other organizations they have done business with. They reported this back to [[Lord Gabriel Rymmer]] and received their reward for their investigation and went on another shopping spree at [[Arcane Oddities]].

The party decided that since their rouse to move an empty box in place of the crystal was likely spilled, that they would do a double-rouse and actually transport the real crystal to [[Lady Thinora Va'del, Archmage of Antiquity]], placed in the safety of your new-found Portable Hole.

## Intro

After traveling across the city unimpeded, you find yourselves in an manor that is more extravagant and spacious on the inside than it appeared on the outside. You are led upstairs to a small study with the afternoon light filtering through stained glass windows, a series of bookshelves against the far wall, and desk in the center of the room with neatly organized papers and books laid out.

To the left of the desk sits Lord Rymmer, his hands crossed over his stomach. His focus is on a woman behind the desk with shoulder-length black hair and wearing extravagant blue and silver robes with a silver staff by her side. Her appearance is impeccably maintained, not a single misplaced hair or fold in her robes and her features portray an unnatural youthfulness. Ember immediately recognizes her necklace bears the symbol of the [[Cerberus Assembly]].

She looks up briefly at you before looking back at Lord Rymmer: "Ah, is this it then?"


## Monologue about the Krynn

* What do you know of the Krynn?
* Those creatures crawled from the hole of their forsaken god and began to assert dominance over the monstrous inhabitants of Xhorhas
* Their strength increases each day as their so-called Dynasty extends its reach
* Soon it will have no place to go besides over the Ashkeeper Peaks, slaughtering all Empire citizens in their way
* I will not stand idly by; we must amass power to prevent any such incursions. To completely eliminate any unnecessary loss of life

## Important Beats
