## Recap

Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria! Last we left off, our intrepid heroes had a long conversation with their patron-to-date Lord Gabriel Rymmer and the recently appointed Archmage of Antiquity, Lady Thinora Va'del. Lady Va'del identified the mysterious amethyst crystal through the use of powerful divination magic and through consulting the journal of Petyr Archeron, Ember's missing father. She reported the item to be known as a Tear of Desirat, one of three keys that seal the ancient fiend Desirat, the Twilight Phoenix. Lord Rymmer agreed in principal to sell the Tear to Lady Va'del for an undisclosed amount in order for it to be under the protection of the Cerberus Assembly rather than be vulnerable to future attacks in his vault.

Lady Va'del then inquired as to the parties' availability for hire, proposing they seek out artifacts from the Age of Arcanum known as the Vestiges of Divergence to aid the Empire in or deter a war with the Krynn Dynasty. She left them Petry's journal which contained some information about the abilities and whereabouts of several of these relics and the party decided to confer as to which to pursue first.

On the way to discuss their path forward, Tato happened upon a shrine of Bahamut where he had a vision and was gifted powers to aid in his newfound purpose.
