## Recap

Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria! Last we left off, our intrepid heroes faced a cross-roads and debated which [[Vestiges of Divergence]] from [[Petyr (Pete) Archeron]]'s journal to pursue, ultimately settling on the Kiss of the Changebringer first.

[[Ember]] and [[Shadowclaw]] did some research on the Changebringer at the Pearl Shrine garnering some valuable religious history of the Prime Deity, but ultimately decided not to pursue any hidden information not available to the public. 

The group accepted a 300 pp advance for their quest and hired the [[Stormrider]], captained by Taliria, to take them to the shores of [[Brokenbank]], [[Tato]]'s home island. The travel to Brokenbank was smooth sailing and our adventurers set foot on the island headed east towards the Temple of the Ascendent Dragon. After fighting some myconids in the jungles of Brokenbank, our adventurers find themselves resting for the evening ready to set off the next day.
