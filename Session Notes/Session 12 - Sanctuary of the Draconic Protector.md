## Recap

Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria! Last we left off our adventurers began their ascent up Brokenveil Peak towards the home of their very own Tato. They stopped by the small village Cliffhaven, warded off some elementals on The Talon Span, and defeated a deafening liondrake on the eastern cliffs of the mountain. Our exhausted adventurers now find themselves within view of the peak accompanied by an injured monk on the cliff face.
