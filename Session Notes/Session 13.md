## Recap

Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria! Last we left off our adventurers finished their ascent up Brokenveil Peak to the *Sanctuary of the Draconic Protector*, the childhood home of our very own Tato.

The gang did some godly research with Arli, cured [[Chives]] from a necromantic curse, and jammed out with some wood blocks. After a few days of much needed rest, our adventurers were summoned to [[Abbot Bok]]'s private meditation grounds.

As you all stand on outer branches of the temple's great tree, Bok turns to [[Tato]] and says: "Show me what you have learned!"

Roll initiative!
