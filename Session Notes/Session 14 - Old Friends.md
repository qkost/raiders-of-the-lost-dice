## Recap

Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria! Last we left off our adventurers had an intense showdown with [[Tato]]'s longtime mentor and leader of the *Sanctuary of the Draconic Protector*, [[Abbot Bok]]. You fought across the boughs of a great tree trading many blows as his fists froze Tato and Kelward into unconsciousness. At the last possible moment, [[Ember]] cast a spell to put the master Monk to sleep and ending the fight.

After some shenanigans with a Fog Cloud spell attempting to prank the sleeping Abbot, a huge imposing form rose from the mists and you saw before you a massive silver dragon. The Abbot introduced his true from as Golos-bok'eir "Shimmerwing" and he provided you some wisdom in your quest, some helpful arcane items, and a flute made from his own scale that you can summon him a single time in a moment of great need.

You then said your goodbyes to your friends new and old and journeyed through the jungles of the island back to the city of Brokenbank.

You find yourselves cresting the final hill overlooking the port city. An array of vessels of all sized lay anchor just off of the port with smaller vessels ferrying crew and cargo into the shallow port. The ramshackle town is bustling with business as goods and fish are traded in the dockside marketplace that is significantly larger than you'd expect for a town on this side. On the far side of town rests the largest establishment, presumably the headquarters of the Portcaller of Brokenbank: Mazin Fahreed.

What would you like to do?
