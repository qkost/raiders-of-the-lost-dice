## Recap

Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria! Last we left off our adventurers returned back to the port town of [[Brokenbank]] and searched for a means of infiltrating a pirate crew. [[Kelward]] deftly persuaded the barkeep at The Salty Kraken and was pointed to some rowdy sailors in the corner, which the party later came to learn were Lyr and Bardrick of the Ill Hand.

Mid discussion with the pirates, a large half-orc woman barged in and demanded the two begin making preparations to ship off, but [[Kelward]] recognized her as [[Tosh Caro]], his former First Mate on the Blue Miranda. With the help of [[Tosh Caro]]'s word the party convinced the tiefling [[Captain Alyson Paij]] that they would be valuable assets as crew on the Ill Hand.

The ship set off later that evening and the party has enjoyed several relatively quiet days on the open sea. [[Kelward]] and [[Ember]] shared some of their respective histories' that they've thus far kept pretty close to the chest.

On the fourth night, [[Shadowclaw]] noticed some sickly green lights in the distance and took to the skies to investigate. As he got closer, the light grew to be the size of a full ship which suddenly faded into the mist on his approach. After returning to the ship, the party came to realize it may not be the only one out there. After informing the crew, [[Captain Alyson Paij]] didn't seem too surprised by this news.

After this sudden realization, [[Kelward]]'s rapier was ripped out of his scabbard and stabbed itself into the deck of the ship behind him. With some clever investigation, [[Shadowclaw]] and [[Ember]] put together that this sword may in fact be one of the Blades of Sehanine seeking its companion.
