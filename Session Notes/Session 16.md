## Recap

Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria! Last we left off our adventurers traveled underwater toward a ship graveyard with Kelward's former (and current) first mate [[Tosh Caro]]. The task was simple: seek out treasures from the long sunken vessels and be back before sundown, or be left behind. Thanks to [[Ember]]'s arcane abilities, the party was able to breath underwater to explore the ocean's depths, while [[Kelward]]'s sword continued to guide them further and further down.

After coming across a chasm in the ocean floor, the party was ambushed by three massive sharks, the largest measuring at least 30 feet in length. Despite the danger these beasts posed, our heroes came through almost completely unscathed.

Our heroes then descended even deeper into the abyss, ultimately encountering Kelward's old ship last known as The Zealot's Tide. Upon approaching the wreck, a sickly green light erupted from the chasm below and engulfed the ship. Ghastly, skeletal pirates began to emerge from the ship and Kelward noticed two familiar cloaked entities sink below deck.

Cumulative time underwater: 1.5 hours
