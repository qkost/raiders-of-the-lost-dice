## Recap

Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria! Last we left off our adventurers had a thrilling showdown with some ghostly remnants of [[Kelward]]'s former crew from the Zealot's Tide. The battle seemed to be going our heroes' way with some good tactics and rolls, but near the end of the fight [[Kelward]] found himself near death and flanked between two spectres he recognized as Kharish and Tarko. With some clutch healing from [[Ember]] and [[Shadowclaw]] and [[Tato]] finishing off the pirates, the party prevailed with all team members in tact.

The team took a much needed short rest below deck of the Tide and pilfered a trove of gold, gems, and magic items well deserved after such a grueling encounter. Still, the sword continues to point downward into the sickening green abyss.

Cumulative time underwater: 2 hours
