## Recap

Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria! Last we left off our adventurers descended into the sickly, green abyss below the Zealot's Tide. You each felt a presence penetrate your mind and learn of your objective and your deepest fears, which manifested in the the ghastly light during your descent. But you pressed onwards.

At the bottom of the trench, you passed some sort of membrane and found yourselves in what appears to be an old Dueregar hall with a giant vault-like door on the far end and two smaller doors on the sides.

You explored the door on the left and discovered a library/laboratory and discovered some ties between a pearl that Kelward hold and this ritual known as the Periapt of Mind Snaring. You took some materials from the library with you and placed them in the Portable Hole.

Cumulative time underwater:
* 2 hours before last session
* Currently 3.5-4 hours

As you turn around to return to the main hallway, what would you like to do?
