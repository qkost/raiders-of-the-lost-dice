## Recap

Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria! Last we left our adventurers  were traveling through seemingly abandoned Dueregar halls on the trail of some sort of necromancer.

You explored a prison where two people were help along with a pit filled with discarded bodies. One of the prisoners was nearly catatonic while the other was eager for you to let them out. Tato noticed, however, that he would not make physical contact and the creature quickly faded through the wall when the ruse was up.

You cautiously entered a large hall with your goal in sight, a small red sword prominently displayed; however, it turned out to be a trap. Appearing out of invisibility, an undead Illithid named [[Ungrudaal]] attempted to pierce your mental defenses while their minions ambushed you. You ultimately prevailed in the encounter as you killed the undead minions, but Ungradaal was *just* able to escape.

This victory, however, came at a great cost as [[Ember]] lie dead as the battle subsided. Tato called upon the one favor of [[Abbot Bok]] and was able to channel his energy to bring her back from the other side.

After some rest, you were able to gather an impressive haul and return back to the [[The Ill Hand]] and were able to retain a good portion of the magic items you acquired including the missing Blade of the Moonweaver.

[[Captain Alyson Paij]] gave the order to set sail back to [[Darktow]].

You look around in your victory as the sun begins to set. On the duskward horizon you see the red and white moons of Exandria just barely overlapping. Barrels of ale and rum are being rolled out onto the deck and the crew is beginning to drink and celebrate their newfound fortune.
