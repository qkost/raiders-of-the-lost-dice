## Recap

Welcome friends back to Exandria! Last we left off our adventurers enjoyed a party on the [[The Ill Hand]] celebrating their hard-earned gold. [[Shadowclaw]] dropped some beats on the bagpipes while [[Tato]] easily won a brawl against three of the crew, but later that evening Shadowclaw had trouble sleeping as the encounter with the mindflayer seemingly awoke something in his mind.

The next day you planned to seek more information on the Captain by talking to [[Tosh Caro]] and later staging a brawl to enable [[Ember]] and [[Kelward]] to sneak into the Captain's quarters. They successfully learned of some information traded with a character named [[Niv]] of the Myriad as well as some conspiracy regarding the leadership of [[Darktow]], but did leave an indication someone had been there as well as a cryptic letter.

In the meantime, Tato's fight with the Captain was epic. She brought out everything she had, including some trickery, and was able to just knock out Tato on her last breath.

We return as Kelward and Ember ascend back up the rear of the ship, still invisible, and look down as the crowd cheers with excitement. Captain Paij reaches her hand down to Tato and picks him up.

"Well, that was one hell of a fight!"
