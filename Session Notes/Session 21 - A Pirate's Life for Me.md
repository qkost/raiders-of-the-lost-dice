## Recap

Welcome friends back to Exandria! Last we left off our adventurers had a nice after-brawl drink with [[Captain Alyson Paij]] where you learned of her disgust for the [[Plank King (Wyatt Maranoss)]] due to the perceived overreach on [[Darktow]] port taxes. You came to a mutual agreement to attempt dismantle his control over the pirate island ,which seemingly aligns with your pursuit of the Kiss of the Changebringer.

You had a few peaceful days at sea, but on the third day you encountered a massive whirlpool with a giant, yet familiar, sea serpent at the center. Through channeling the Blades of the Moonweaver, an incredible fireball, and flying fists, you dispatched this draconic monster as quickly as it came.
