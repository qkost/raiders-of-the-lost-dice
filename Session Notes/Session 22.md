Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria! Last we left off our adventurers finished their trip to Darktow, guiding the ship through the dangerous Dragshallow Reef. Upon arrival, a new friend from the Ill Hand, Keldor, gave you a quick introduction to the island. You ate some delicious clam chowder and spent the night at The Crashing Tusk after paying complements to the bugbear chef Givrok.

Over the next few days, Ember learned of some forgery in the latter portions of her father's journal which was seemingly covered up with some intricate magic. Kelward bought a fancy platinum watch and earned the ire of a halfling trader in the Bargain Tract with an Oops-Stone prank. And Tato entered in a tournament at Tidepool Arena where the reigning champion is a fellow tortle named [[Grogar, The Ironshell]].

You have three weeks of downtime and information gathering before Captain Paij's potential allies are due to arrive. What would you like to do?
