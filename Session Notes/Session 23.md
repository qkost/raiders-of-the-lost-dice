## Recap

Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria! In our last session, our brave group was navigating the pirate town of Darktow.

Their journey took them through the Scamper Tract, mingling with some of Darktow's most influential captains and staunch supporters of the Plank King. Here, they unearthed two significant leads. The first involved Captain Covey, known as "The Sea Wolf," who had recently been banished following a clash with the Plank King. After speaking with Captain Paij, they chose not to pursue this druidic captain immediately. The second lead concerned Ysolda Banne, a key lieutenant to the King, instrumental in bolstering the defenses of the Throne Roost.

The group's next mission was to overthrow the true king, Givrok, famed for owning the "Best Clam Chowder in Darktow" apron. They tracked down Gruff to The Crashing Tusk's clam supplier and bought spices in the Bargain Tract.

Meanwhile, Ember ventured to the temple of Ioun, the Knowing Mentor, only to discover mostly empty. Next door, the Cliffkeep Archives appeared to have been closed by Ysolda Banne, with its knowledge moved to her residence, the Rungaa Towers.

As we resume our adventure, it's the morning of Tato's big showdown at the Tidepool Arena. The day breaks with seabirds singing and the first rays of sunlight dancing on the ocean waves.
