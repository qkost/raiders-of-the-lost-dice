Welcome friends back to Exandria! Last we left off, our intrepid heroes continued their pursuit of the Kiss of the Changebringer on the Isle of Darktow.

They learned from their friend Keldor of some tunnels interlaced throughout the island, perhaps some that go in proximity of the Throne Roost.

Lady Thinora contacted the party requesting status and seemed disappointed they hadn't had the success of another group she had hired called the Black Iron Pact.

The party then took to their companion they had rescued from the depths and cured her ailment with the help of a cleric of the Wildmother. Upon coming to her senses, she offered her tattoo skills up to the party.

Then, finally, the day came for Tato's fights in the Tidepool Arena. Kelward and company stirred up quite the support of the crowed through magical effects and stirring speeches and Tato followed through with domination in the first two rounds of combat; however, Grogar "The Ironshell" dispatched with his opponents with a similar ease.

During the final round, Draang and his Peacekeeper arrested Captain Paij. The party nearly came to blows, but cooler heads prevailed with the only raucous being Kelward drew some attention to himself by casting a spell on Paij.

Shadowclaw then tracked Paij back to the Throne Roost and got a good look at the exterior while Kelward adeptly stole Paij's treasonous papers out from under the noses of some Peacekeepers.

We return to our adventurers on the evening after Tato's last fight in the Smelter's Nook.
