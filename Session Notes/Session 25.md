## Recap

Welcome friends back to Exandria! Last we left off our heroes were continuing their pursuit of the Kiss of the Changebringer in Darktow.

They learned of Lyr's betrayal of the Ill Hand and the bounties out for the officers and Kelward. After some searching around in the Guzzle Tract and Harbor Tract, they found Tosh laying low in the Bloated Cup Tavern where she could keep a close eye on the ship.

You then spent the rest of the evening plotting potential approaches: talking with Ysolda Banne, scouting the tunnels, starting a rebellion, or having Kelward be arrested.

You find yourselves waking up in the Smelter's Nook. It's hard to tell the time of day in the cool interior of the cavern.

What would you like to do?


## TODO

* Ship battle on the Ill Hand


## Notes

* Tosh told to wait for them, but probably 3-6 AM
