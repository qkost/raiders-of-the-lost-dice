## Recap

Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria! Last we left off our heroes began the exploration of the caverns beneath the Throne Roost.

They spent some time clearing out a collapsed tunnel and Tato deftly evaded the detection of a roving worm-like scout automaton while scouting the area. When the rest of the party joined, however, Grogar and Tato brought a little too much attention to the party and they were assaulted by two stalactite-like enemies whose tendrils reeled their victims into a vicious bite.

During the battle, they managed to dispatch the scout before it and, after a good struggle, brought down the tentacle monsters as well.

You now find yourselves in the dark, damp cavern. What would you like to do?
