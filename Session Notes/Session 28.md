## Recap

Welcome friends back to Exandria! Last we left off our adventurers trudged down a shallow stream and encountered a few of Draang's Peacekeepers who were carrying a chest through the tunnels below the Throne Roost. After quickly dispatching two, you interrogated the third with Kelward's intimidating show of sparks.

He mentioned that they were carrying treasure down as an offering to a dragon turtle named Idok. He also described the path that they follow from the Throne Roost, which you followed.

Once in the basement of the Throne Roost, you were discovered chatting by a wandering guard who sounded the alarm. You managed to take down some more Peacekeepers while a few fled to regroup.

You now find yourselves mid-combat, one cross-bow woman having fled to the west on the bottom floor and another on the middle floor.
