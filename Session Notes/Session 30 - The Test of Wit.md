## Recap

Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria! Last we left off [[Shadowclaw]]'s vision faded to wind and darkness as he was transported to the realm of his patron, [[No Name]]. With a bit of tricky wordplay, [[Shadowclaw]] gave his name to this slenderman-esque monstrosity before agreeing to a bit of a wager.

[[Shadowclaw]] selected [[Kelward]] to accompany him in a series of challenges with high stakes. You sought to gain promised power at the potential cost of something dear to you: your name, your memories, or your concertina.

You mastered the Test of Whimsy passing most of the carnival games with ease, but struggled with the strength test and thus faced some displacer beasts.

You then faced the Test of Wile, a mirror maze. Two doppelgangers mimicked your partners and got the drop on [[Shadowclaw]] while [[Kelward]] caught on quickly.

You now find yourself faced with the Test of Wit. (improvise introduction to giant chess board)
