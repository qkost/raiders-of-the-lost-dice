## Recap

Welcome friends back to Exandria! Last we left off our heroes stormed the Throne Roost.

Ember immolated the majority of [[Halvar Draang]]'s forces leaving him isolated for the rest of the group to beat him down with Kelward landing the killing blow. You freed [[Captain Alyson Paij]] from one of the cells and coerced the cleric to use her remaining magical abilities to heal you before throwing her and two unconscious orcs into cells.

You then met with the [[Plank King (Wyatt Maranoss)]] and his shield guardian. The automaton smashed you back with it's massive axe arm and the Plank King cut many of you to the brink of death with his wicked black metal blade. But through effective strategy and perseverance, you laid the king of the pirates low with a point-blank magic missile.

You gathered the loot that you found, but quickly discovered that a small army of automata now approached the castle forcing you back to the underground cavern system you entered from.

You then took a short rest and during that rest [[Shadowclaw]] and [[Kelward]] drifted off into the chaotic realm of Shadowclaw's patron. The looming, pasty white, slenderman/pale man/mouth of Sauron-esque creature, [[No Name]], took Shadowclaw's name and then challenged you to a series of carnival games: the Test of Wit, Wile, and Whimsy.

You mastered the test of Whimsy and it's wicked twists on classic carnival games. You then entered the mirror maze for the Test of Wile; ultimately defeating twisted versions of yourselves. You then faced the Test of Wit, a massive chess game where [[Kelward]] fell, but [[Shadowclaw]] managed to take down the King with no energy left to spare.

[[No Name]] then gave you back your name and promised rewards and gave some cryptic answers to your questions regarding Thinora, Ysolda, and [[Ember]]'s father [[Petyr (Pete) Archeron]]. You then were returned back to the dark cave below the Throne Roost.

You now find yourselves peering into a cove with a beached ship covered in gold with a gargantuan dragon turtle in the center of the shallow water.
