## Recap

Welcome friends back to Exandria! Last we left off our heroes faced against the gargantuan dragon turtle, [[Idok (Dragon Turtle)]].

[[Tato]] and [[Grogar, The Ironshell]] approached the dragon and treated with him, which went... badly. It did, however, buy some time for [[Kelward]] to scour [[Idok (Dragon Turtle)]]'s hoard in search of the Kiss of the Changebringer.

Right as it became clear that the confrontation with [[Idok (Dragon Turtle)]] was turning violent, [[Kelward]] found the vestige and the party mad a mad dash to escape.

Most of the party became badly scalded with [[Kelward]], [[Tato]], and [[Grogar, The Ironshell]] all falling at some point. With some clutch movement and some hasted assistance, [[Shadowclaw]] was able to swoop in and pick up the nearly dead [[Kelward]].

As you fled back into the tunnels, [[Idok (Dragon Turtle)]] called out:

"Flee insects! We'll see how you fair without your precious ships!"
