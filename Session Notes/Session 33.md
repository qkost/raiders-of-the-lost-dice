## Recap

Welcome friends back to Exandria! Last we left off our heroes made their way back from [[Idok (Dragon Turtle)]]'s lair into the heart of [[Darktow]], dispatching a few automatons on the way.

After emerging from [[Darktow]], you immediately noticed the chaos and looting that has ensued after the fall of [[Plank King (Wyatt Maranoss)]] and [[Halvar Draang]].

[[Shadowclaw]] went and warned the [[The Ill Hand]] (currently under the control of Lyr) of the coming dragon turtle and then told [[Tosh Caro]] to gather her men to take the ship.

Meanwhile, the rest of the gang treated with [[Ysolda Banne - Artificer]] in the Throne Roost. She seemed eager to take the gold and cut and run. She was in a full position of power seeing how exhausted you were with two shield guardians at her side; however, the incredible persuasiveness of [[Ember]] and [[Kelward]] got through to her in at least some small way. She lent you a bracelet that has control over two Oaken Bolters to aid in your fight with Idok.

You retrieved the promised Bolters and spent some time healing up and divvying up loot including your newly-acquired vestige.

As you head back towards the Harbor Tract, you hear a large crash as the first ship sinks at the port.

What would you like to do?
