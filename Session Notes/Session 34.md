## Recap

Welcome friends back to Exandria! Last we left off our heroes finished attuning to their shiny new magic items. [[Ember]] then explored the Rungaa towers and got some insight into what [[Ysolda Banne - Artificer]] has been up to.

You then headed down to the docks, helping [[Tosh Caro]] in her duel with Lyr. You then prepared for battle as steam began to rise from the harbor and [[Idok (Dragon Turtle)]] burst through a boat.

The dragon turtle landed one breath weapon, bringing some of you to the edge, but the combination of a well placed faerie fire and stun kept the dragon locked down while you tore it to pieces.

We pick up in the aftermath of the fight as you were planning to head back into [[Darktow]] to finish up some business.
