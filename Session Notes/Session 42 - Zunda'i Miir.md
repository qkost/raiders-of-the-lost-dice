## Notes
## Prep
### 1. Review Characters

* [[Ember]] - 
* [[Kelward]] -
* [[Shadowclaw]] - psionic ties to [[Ungrudaal]]
* [[Tato]] - 

### 2. Strong Start

* [[Shadowclaw]] is in the lair
* 5 thin and narrow shards of amethyst floating in the air in a line to the right
* Notice bits of yellow flecks (gold) suspended in the nearby amethyst

### 3. Scenes

* Detect thoughts on Shadowclaw - probe for Ungradaal contact
- "You! Mortal touched by the Far Realm. By what foolishness do you find yourself in my lair?"
- Say they can all go down, but Shadowclaw cannot return this way empty-handed
- Zunda'i-Miir can control chimneys - top opens to sky and bottom is tunnel to the underdark
- Plagued by dreams. Hasn't slumbered in 12 seasons
- "I dream of a void-like entity. A creature of rolling, hungry ink and darkness a spreading cloud of lightless destruction. . It is endless, black, inky, filled with teeth and malice, laughter and hatred. And from the void endless streams of aberrations are begotten. One such shares the toothy maw of its master, surrounded by lidless eyes."
- "While most before it have foolishly tried to escape my mountain and thus were destroyed, this one is more clever. It hides, waits, and slowly works its way through my psionic defenses. Biding its time until it believes it can make an escape."
- The work of a beholder, clever and more insidious than most. Something different about this one; sense a influence of madness from the Abyss.
