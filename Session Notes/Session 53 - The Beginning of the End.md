## Recap

* Talked to Grand Maven Gameshega in the Cerulean Palace of [[Ank'harel]]
	* [[Ember]] and [[Tato]] convinced her for an immediate audience with [[J'mon Sa Ord (Devo'ssa)]]
	* Expressed urgency due to involvement of other dragons ([[Abbot Bok (Shimmerwing)]]) and extraplanar beings
* Met J'mon in the Alluvium Gardens
	* Tato convinced her to grant him her blessing
	* She transformed into the great dragon Devo'ssa and challenged [[Tato]] to a duel
	* Tato emerged victorious, and gained the ability to channel her lightning breath
* J'mon then granted Tato more of her strength, transforming the [[Wraps of Dyamak]] in to the Mark of the Platinum Dragon
* Bought a bunch of potions (I didn't write down)
	* Potion of Speed
	* Some number of potions of healing of various rarities
	* Potion of heroism?
* Rested in the Cerulean Palace
* Utilized the Nexus Stone (icosohedron Kefra had) to teleport to the Foyer of Thinora's Demiplane
	* The chandelier animated in the room and said: "Welcome my dear Kefra. Please take a seat and my assistant will be with you in a moment. Don't venture too far now, it can get a bit dangerous."
	* Opened the left door in the Foyer using fire spells
	* Decided to lay in wait and ambush the assistant
