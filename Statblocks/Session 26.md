Welcome friends back to the world of Exandria! Last we left off, our adventurers continued their pursuit of the Kiss of the Changebringer in Darktow.

They gang sought out the help of Grogar, who agreed to accompany them storming the Throne Roost, and then headed out to visit Ysolda Banne.

After a nearly violent confrontation, Ysolda agreed to provide information in exchange for half of the treasure taken from the Plank King. She detailed the layout and defenses including traps and descriptions of some of her automatons.

You then headed into the tunnels and had a brief encounter with a ray-like aberration known as a cloaker before encountering the partially collapsed tunnel that you think matches Ysolda's description.

Minor cleanup additional information Ysolda would have told you:
* Arcane nature of the constructs grants them exceptional resistance to magical effects (i.e. adv. on magical saves)

What would you like to do?

## TODO

* Ship battle
* Evil cleric that is keeping Paij at 1 hitpoint during torture
